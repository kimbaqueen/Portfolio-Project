<!-- Tech-Moms Portfolio project -->

Part of the 9 week Tech-moms program is to create a portfolio website to present at graduation. New skills learned include HTML, CSS, and beginnings of Javascript. 

Website Project:
I often find myself searching online for community resources, and the results are scattered at best! I wanted to find a solution in putting together an online compilation of various local and national resources available that can be extremely helpful for people looking for career develpment and particularly those who are underrepresented in professional vocations of various industries. 

Considerations:
I started a javascript extension file but was not able to complete the coding. I plan to continue learning more coding skills and update the site with the correct JS so it can be fully functional!

Conclusion:
I'm amazed how much we learned in so little time and am very excited to start my next bootcamp to continue learning more tech skills! Additionally, I plan to keep updating this site with new skills I learn. It' so important to me to advocate for under-represented communities, build confidence, mentor, and help others change the trajectory of their path. We can all do hard things!
